# Blogroll History

This project attempts to visually display how a person's blog roll has changed over time using backups of OPML files.

This evolved from an [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/5d1882f77f5a6ce4), which has more of the story and process.

The python files here are very rough and produced the data necessary for the initial graph show in Observable, but they didn't make for a very maintainable or extensible graph. Here's a screenshot of that version:
